# DeepSP


In this repository, we share the code in C++ and the training, test data, and the values of the parameters that we got after training.
Please note that the training file must be downloaded. Please send an email if you want that file or read the readme.txt.
Please, install mlpack library https://www.mlpack.org before compiling.

For building your training set and validation set, please use the Backtracking Survey Propagation Algorithm code. You can download it at https://github.com/RaffaeleMarino/The-Backtracking-Survey-Propagation-Algorithm-code
