# DeepSP


In this repository, we share the code in C++ of DeepSP.
Please note that the training set and validation set data must be downloaded. Please read the readme.txt file.
Please, install mlpack library https://www.mlpack.org before compiling.

For building your training set and validation set, please use the Backtracking Survey Propagation Algorithm code. You can download it at https://github.com/RaffaeleMarino/The-Backtracking-Survey-Propagation-Algorithm-code 

The file model.xml contains the parameters' values of the Neural Network used for obtaining the results presented in the manuscript.
